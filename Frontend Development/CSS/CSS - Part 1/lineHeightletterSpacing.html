        <h1>Indian Institute of Science</h1>
        <p>
            The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) is a public, deemed, research university for higher 
            education and research in science, engineering, design, and management. 
            It is located in the southern Indian city of Bangalore, Karnataka. 
            The institute was established in 1909 with active support from Jamsetji 
            Tata and thus is also locally known as the Tata Institute.[5] 
            It was granted a deemed university status in 1958 and recognized as an Institute of Eminence in 2018.[6]

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            After an accidental meeting between Jamsetji Tata and Swami Vivekananda, on a ship in 1893 
            where they discussed Tata's plan of bringing the steel industry to India, 
            Tata wrote to Vivekananda five years later: "I trust, you remember me as a fellow-traveller on your voyage from Japan to Chicago. 
            I very much recall at this moment your views on the growth of the ascetic spirit in India... 
            I recall these ideas in connection with my scheme of Research Institute of Science for India.

            A number of other research institutes, Raman Research Institute, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), 
            Wood Research Institute and Central Power Research Institute (CPRI), are close to IISc. Most of these institutes are connected to IISc 
            by a regular shuttle bus service.[23] The campus houses more than 40 departments marked by routes such as the Gulmohar Marga,
